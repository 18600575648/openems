== Introduction

OpenEMS is a modular platform for energy management applications.
It was developed around the requirements of controlling, monitoring and integrating energy storage systems together with renewable energy sources and complementary devices and services.

=== OpenEMS IoT stack

The OpenEMS 'Internet of Things' stack contains three main components:

 * **OpenEMS Edge** runs on-site and actually controls the devices
 * **OpenEMS UI** is the generic user interface
 * **OpenEMS Backend** runs on a (cloud) server, connects the decentralized Edge systems and provides aggregation, monitoring and control via internet

=== Features

The OpenEMS software architecture was designed to leverage some features that are required by a modern and flexible Energy Management System:

 * Fast, PLC-like control of battery inverters and other devices
 * Easily extendable due to the use of modern programming languages and modular architecture
 * Wide range of supported devices - (battery) inverters, meters, etc. - and protocols
 * Modern web-based real-time user interface

=== Open Source philosophy

OpenEMS development was started by https://www.fenecon.de[FENECON GmbH icon:external-link[]], a German company specialized in manufacturing and project development of energy storage systems. It is the software stack behind https://fenecon.de/page/fems[FEMS - FENECON Energy Management System icon:external-link[]] and widely used in private, commercial and industrial applications.

We are inviting third parties - like universities, hardware manufacturers, software companies, commercial and private owners,... - to use OpenEMS for their own projects and are glad to support them with their first steps. In any case if you are interested in OpenEMS our development team would be glad to hear from you at fems@fenecon.de.

OpenEMS is funded by several federal and EU funding projects. If you are a developer and you would like to get hired by one of the partner companies or universities for working on OpenEMS, please send your motivation letter to fems@fenecon.de.

=== Development guidelines

Development follows the https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_Softwareentwicklung[Agile Manifesto icon:external-link[]] and is driven by the https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum[Scrum icon:external-link[]] methodology. 
The source code is available online at http://openems.io and on https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems[GitHub icon:github[]]. 
New versions are released after every Scrum Sprint and https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/releases[tagged icon:github[]] accordingly. 
Version numbers are built using the pattern `year.number of sprint`, e.g. version `2018.4` is the result of the fourth sprint in 2018. 
Git development follows the https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow[Gitflow Workflow], so the https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/tree/master/[master branch icon:github[]] always holds the stable release, while active development is happening on the https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/tree/develop[develop branch icon:github[]] or in separate feature branches.

For Edge and Backend Java development we recommend the https://www.eclipse.org/ide/[Eclipse IDE icon:external-link[]].
For the UI (TypeScript + Angular.io) we recommend https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code icon:external-link[]]. 
The documentation is generated using http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc icon:external-link[]]. 
For handling git we recommend https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/[Sourctree by Atlassian icon:external-link[]].

// TODO remove this after migration to OSGi is finished
=== Migration to OSGi

Starting with version https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/releases/tag/2018.7[2018.7 icon:github[]] OpenEMS Edge is getting migrated to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi[OSGi icon:external-link[]], a platform to provide a completely modular and dynamic service oriented system. Certain parts of Edge are not yet migrated and for the time being only available in the deprecated https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/tree/old_master[old_master branch icon:github[]].

=== System architecture

OpenEMS is generally used in combination with external hardware and software components
(the exception is a simulated development environment - see https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/blob/old_master/README.md#get-started[Getting Started])
As a brief overview, this is how OpenEMS is used in production setups:

... Accept the default values and click btn:[Save]

... You created your first instance of an OpenEMS Component with ID "scheduler0". The log shows:
+
`INFO  [onent.AbstractOpenemsComponent] [scheduler0] Activate AllAlphabetically [edge.scheduler.allalphabetically]`
+
Add any other OpenEMS Components in the same way:

.. Configure debug outputs on the console: "Controller Debug Log". The default values can be accepted without changes.
+
.Configuration of Controller Debug Log
image::config-controller-debug-log.png[Configuration of Controller Debug Log]
+
The log shows:
+

+
followed once per second by
+
`INFO  [e.controller.debuglog.DebugLog] [ctrlDebugLog0] _sum[Ess SoC:0 %|L:0 W Grid L:0 W Production L:0 W Consumption L:0 W]`.
+
NOTE: It is once per second because you accepted the default value of "1000 ms" for "Cycle time" in the Scheduler configuration.

.. Configure the standard-load-profile datasource: "Simulator DataSource: Standard Load Profile". The default values can be accepted without changes.
+
.Configuration of Simulator DataSource: Standard Load Profile
image::config-simulator-datasource-standard-load-profile.png[Configuration of Simulator DataSource: Standard Load Profile]
+
The log shows:
+
`INFO  [onent.AbstractOpenemsComponent] [datasource0] Activate StandardLoadProfileDatasource [edge.simulator.datasource.standardloadprofile]`,
+
NOTE: The data source was configured with the OpenEMS Component ID "datasource0" which will be used in the next step as reference.

+
.Configuration of Simulator GridMeter Acting
image::config-simulator-grid-meter-acting.png[Configuration of Simulator GridMeter Acting]
+
This time some more logs will show up. Most importantly they show, that the Grid meter now shows a power value.
+
----
INFO  [onent.AbstractOpenemsComponent] [meter0] Activate GridMeter [edge.simulator.meter.grid.acting]
[onent.AbstractOpenemsComponent] [meter0] Deactivate GridMeter [edge.simulator.meter.grid.acting]

[e.controller.debuglog.DebugLog] [ctrlDebugLog0] _sum[Ess SoC:0 %|L:0 W Grid L:1423 W Production L:0 W Consumption L:1423 W] meter0[1423 W] 
----
+
NOTE: This setup causes the simulated grid-meter to take the standardized load-profiles data as input parameter.
+
NOTE: 'Acting' referrs to the fact, that this meter actively provides data - in opposite to a 'Reacting' device that is reacting on other components: for example the 'Simulator.EssSymmetric.Reacting' configured below.

.. Configure a simulated reacting energy storage system: "Simulator EssSymmetric Reacting". The default values can be accepted without changes.
+
.Configuration of Simulator EssSymmetric Reacting
image::config-simulator-esssymmetric-reacting.png[Configuration of Simulator EssSymmetric Reacting]
+
The log shows:
+
`INFO  [e.controller.debuglog.DebugLog] [ctrlDebugLog0] _sum[Ess SoC:50 %|L:0 W Grid L:864 W Production L:0 W Consumption L:864 W] ess0[SoC:50 %|L:0 W|OnGrid] meter0[864 W]`
+
Note, that the DebugLog now shows data for the battery, but the charge/discharge power stays at "0 W" and the state of charge stays at "50 %" as configured. Next step is to configure a control algorithm that tells the battery to charge or discharge.

.. Configure the self-consumption optimization algorithm: "Controller Balancing Symmetric". Configure the Ess-ID "ess0" and Grid-Meter-ID "meter0" to refer to the components configured above.
+

+
NOTE: Note, how the Controller now tells the battery to discharge (`Ess SoC:49 %|L:1167 W`), trying to balance the Grid power to "0 W" (`Grid L:-39 W`):

.. Configure the websocket Api Controller: "Controller Api Websocket". The default values can be accepted without changes.
+
.Configuration of Controller Api Websocket

== Core concepts & terminology

This chapter describes some of the core concepts and commonly used terms in OpenEMS:

=== Bundle

OpenEMS Edge is using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi[OSGi icon:external-link[]] platform to provide a completely modular and dynamic service oriented system.

Logical groups of source code are put into one OSGi Bundle. Every directory in the source code root directory starting with 'io.openems.*' is a bundle. 

=== Component

OpenEMS Edge is built of Components, i.e. every main component implements the link:../io.openems.edge.common/src/io/openems/edge/common/component/OpenemsComponent.java[OpenemsComponent interface icon:code[]]. 

By definition each Component has a unique ID. Those *Component-IDs* are typically:

* `ess0` for the first storage system or battery inverter
* `ess1` for the second storage system or battery inverter
* ...
* `meter0` for the first meter in the system
* ...

If you receive your OpenEMS together with a FENECON energy storage system, you will find the following Component-IDs:

* FENECON Pro
** `ess0`: FENECON Pro Ess
// TODO link:../edge/src/io/openems/impl/device/pro/FeneconProEss.java[FENECON Pro Ess icon:code[]]
** `meter0`: Socomec grid meter
// TODO link:../edge/src/io/openems/impl/device/socomec/SocomecMeter.java[Socomec grid meter icon:code[]]
** `meter1`: FENECON Pro production meter 
// TODO link:../edge/src/io/openems/impl/device/pro/FeneconProPvMeter.java[FENECON Pro production meter icon:code[]]

* FENECON Mini
** `ess0`: FENECON Mini
// TODO link:../edge/src/io/openems/impl/device/minireadonly/FeneconMiniEss.java[FENECON Mini icon:code[]]
** `meter0`: FENECON Mini grid meter
// TODO link:../edge/src/io/openems/impl/device/minireadonly/FeneconMiniGridMeter.java[FENECON Mini grid meter icon:code[]]
** `meter1`: FENECON Mini production meter
// TODO link:../edge/src/io/openems/impl/device/minireadonly/FeneconMiniProductionMeter.java[FENECON Mini production meter icon:code[]]

=== Channel

Each OpenemsComponent provides a number of Channels. Each represents a single piece of information. Each Channel implements the link:../io.openems.edge.common/src/io/openems/edge/common/channel/Channel.java[Channel interface icon:code[]]. By definition each Channel has a unique ID within its parent Component.

=== Nature

Natures extend normal Java interfaces with 'Channels'. If a Component implements a Nature it also needs to provide the required Channels. For example the Energy Storage System (ESS) Simulator link:../io.openems.edge.simulator/src/io/openems/edge/simulator/ess/symmetric/reacting/EssSymmetric.java[Simulator.EssSymmetric.Reacting icon:code[]] implements the link:../io.openems.edge.ess.api/src/io/openems/edge/ess/api/Ess.java[Ess interface icon:code[]] and therefor needs to provide a `Soc` Channel that provides the current 'State of Charge' of the battery.

<<Controller>>s are written against Nature implementations. Example: A Controller can be used with any ESS, because it can be sure that it provides all the data the Controller requires for its algorithm.

// TODO: add link to all Natures below. Existing Nature implementations are described below.

=== Channel Address

By combining the unique *Component-ID* and *Channel-ID* each Channel in the system can be addressed by a distinct 'Channel Address' in the form `Component-ID/Channel-ID`.

Example: the state of charge ("Soc") of the first energy storage system ("ess0") has the channel address `ess0/Soc`.

=== Scheduler

_see <<Scheduler and Controller>> below

// TODO: add link to all Schedulers below. Existing Scheduler implementations are described below.

=== Controller

The actual business logic or algorithms are wrapped as 'Controllers'. i.e. they implement the link:../io.openems.edge.controller.api/src/io/openems/edge/controller/api/Controller.java[Controller interface icon:code[]]. Each Controller holds one specific, encapsulated task.

// TODO: add link to all Controllers below. Existing Controller implementations are described below.

== OpenEMS Edge

OpenEMS Edge is the core component of the energy management that runs on-site and is responsible for communicating with and controling of external hardware like battery systems, inverters, meters and so on.

=== Architecture

The OpenEMS Edge software architecture is carefully designed to abstract device communication and control algorithms in a way to provide maximum flexibility, predictability and stability, while simplifying the process of implementing new components.

==== Input-Process-Output

OpenEMS Edge is built around the well-known IPO (input-process-output) model which defines the internal execution cycle.

.Input-Process-Output model
image::input-process-output.png[Input-Process-Output model]

Input::
During the input phase all relevant information - e.g. the current 'state of charge' of a battery - is collected and provided as a *process image*. This process image is guaranteed to never change during the cycle.

Process::
The process phase runs algorithms and tasks based on the process image - e.g. an algorithm uses the 'state of charge' information to evaluate whether a digital output should be turned on.

Output::
The output phase takes the results from the process phase and applies it - e.g. it turns the digital output on or off.

==== Scheduler and Controller

During the 'process' phase different algorithms (Controllers) might try to access the same resources - e.g. two Controllers try to switch the same digital output. It is therefor necessary to prioritize their execution and restrict access according to priority.

OpenEMS Edge uses Scheduler implementations to receive a sorted list of Controllers. The Controllers are then executed in order. Later executed Controllers are not allowed to overwrite a previously written result. 

.IPO model with Scheduler and Controllers
image::input-process-scheduler-output.png[IPO model with Scheduler and Controllers]

==== Cycle

The input-process-output model in OpenEMS Edge is executed in a Cycle - implemented by the link:../io.openems.edge.core/src/io/openems/edge/cycle/Cycle.java[Cycle component icon:code[]]). It handles the setting of a process image in the input phase and executes the Controllers in the process phase. Furthermore it emits Cycle Events that can be used in other Components to synchronize with the Cycle.  

.OpenEMS Edge Cycle
image::edge-cycle.png[OpenEMS Edge Cycle]

==== Asynchronous threads and Cycle synchronization

Communication with external hardware and services needs to be executed in asynchronous threads to not block the system. At the same time, those threads need to synchronize with the Cycle.

The following example shows, how the link:../io.openems.edge.bridge.modbus/src/io/openems/edge/bridge/modbus/AbstractModbusBridge.java[Modbus implementation icon:code[]] uses Cycle Events to synchronize with the Cycle:

.Synchronize Cycle with Modbus read/write 
image::cycle-modbus.png[Synchronize Cycle with Modbus read/write]

=== Configuration

OpenEMS Edge and Backend are configured using the standard OSGi configuration admin service. The easiest way to set a configuration is via the http://localhost:8080/system/console/configMgr[Apache Felix Web Console Configuration icon:external-link[]] as described in the <<_getting_started>> guide above.

.Apache Felix Web Console Configuration
image::apache-felix-console-configuration.png[Apache Felix Web Console Configuration]

Configuration via OpenEMS UI is currently not available due to the ongoing <<_migration_to_osgi>>. Once migration is finished, it is going to be possible to change every configuration using the settings menu in OpenEMS UI - directly to OpenEMS Edge and via Backend.

.OpenEMS UI Configuration

=== Hardware

This chapter covers hardware related topics around OpenEMS Edge.
It describes how physical hardware is abstracted using _Natures_, how standardized physical connection layers and protocols are implemented using _Bridges_ and shows which _Devices and Services_ are implemented. The chapter concludes with a development tutorial on how to implement a device. 

==== Natures

Physical hardware is abstracted in OpenEMS Edge using _Natures_. A Nature defines a set of characteristics and attributes which need to be provided by each OpenEMS component that implements it. These characteristics are defined by Channels. For example an implementation of an `Ess` (Energy Storage System), needs to provide an `Soc`-Channel (State of charge of the battery).

Technically Natures are implemented as OSGi API Bundles.
