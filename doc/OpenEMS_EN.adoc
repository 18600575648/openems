= OpenEMS: Open Energy Management System
include::_include/header.adoc[]

== Introduction

OpenEMS is a modular platform for energy management applications.
It was developed around the requirements of controlling, monitoring and integrating energy storage systems together with renewable energy sources and complementary devices and services.

=== OpenEMS IoT stack

The OpenEMS 'Internet of Things' stack contains three main components:

 * **OpenEMS Edge** runs on site and actually controls the devices
 * **OpenEMS UI** is the generic user interface
 * **OpenEMS Backend** runs on a (cloud) server, connects the decentralized Edge systems and provides aggregation, monitoring and control via internet

=== Features

The OpenEMS software architecture was designed to leverage some features that are required by a modern and flexible Energy Management System:

 * Fast, PLC-like control of battery inverters and other devices
 * Easily extendable due to the use of modern programming languages and modular architecture
 * Wide range of supported devices - (battery) inverters, meters, etc. - and protocols
 * Modern web-based real-time user interface

=== Open Source philosophy

OpenEMS development was started by https://www.fenecon.de[FENECON GmbH icon:external-link[]], a German company specialized in manufacturing and project development of energy storage systems. It is the software stack behind https://fenecon.de/page/fems[FEMS - FENECON Energy Management System icon:external-link[]] and widely used in private, commercial and industrial applications.

We are inviting third parties - like universities, hardware manufacturers, software companies, commercial and private owners,... - to use OpenEMS for their own projects and are glad to support them with their first steps. In any case if you are interested in OpenEMS our development team would be glad to hear from you at fems@fenecon.de.

OpenEMS is funded by several federal and EU funding projects. If you are a developer and you would like to get hired by one of the partner companies or universities for working on OpenEMS, please send your motivation letter to fems@fenecon.de.

=== Development guidelines

Development follows the https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_Softwareentwicklung[Agile Manifesto icon:external-link[]] and is driven by the https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum[Scrum icon:external-link[]] methodology. 
The source code is available online at http://openems.io and on https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems[GitHub icon:github[]]. 
New versions are released after every Scrum Sprint and https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/releases[tagged icon:github[]] accordingly. 
Version numbers are built using the pattern `year.number of sprint`, e.g. version `2018.4` is the result of the fourth sprint in 2018. 
Git development follows the https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow[Gitflow Workflow], so the https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/tree/master/[master branch icon:github[]] always holds the stable release, while active development is happening on the https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/tree/develop[develop branch icon:github[]] or in separate feature branches.

For Edge and Backend Java development we recommend the https://www.eclipse.org/ide/[Eclipse IDE icon:external-link[]].
For the UI (TypeScript + Angular.io) we recommend https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code icon:external-link[]]. 
The documentation is generated using http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc icon:external-link[]]. 
For handling git we recommend https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/[Sourctree by Atlassian icon:external-link[]].

=== System architecture

OpenEMS is generally used in combination with external hardware and software components
(the exception is a simulated development environment - see https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/blob/old_master/README.md#get-started[Getting Started])
As a brief overview, this is how OpenEMS is used in production setups:

+
.OpenEMS Edge initial log output
image::eclipse-edge-initial-log-output.png[OpenEMS Edge initial log output]

. Configure and start the Simulator
.. Open the http://localhost:8080/system/console/configMgr[Apache Felix Web Console Configuration icon:external-link[]].
+
Login with username *admin* and password *admin*.
+
.Apache Felix Web Console Configuration
image::apache-felix-console-configuration.png[Apache Felix Web Console Configuration]

.. Configure a Scheduler
+
NOTE: The Scheduler is responsible for executing the control algorithms (Controllers) and defines the OpenEMS Edge application cycle
// TODO: link to Scheduler description

... Click on "Scheduler All Alphabetically"
+
.Configuration of All Alphabetically Scheduler
image::config-scheduler-all-alphabetically.png[Configuration of All Alphabetically Scheduler]

... Accept the default values and click btn:[Save]

... You created your first instance of an OpenEMS Component with ID "scheduler0". The log shows:
+
`INFO  [onent.AbstractOpenemsComponent] [scheduler0] Activate AllAlphabetically [edge.scheduler.allalphabetically]`
+
Add any other OpenEMS Components in the same way:

.. Configure debug outputs on the console: "Controller Debug Log". The default values can be accepted without changes.
+
.Configuration of Controller Debug Log
image::config-controller-debug-log.png[Configuration of Controller Debug Log]
+
The log shows:
+
`INFO  [onent.AbstractOpenemsComponent] [ctrlDebugLog0] Activate DebugLog [edge.controller.debuglog]`,
+
followed once per second by
+
`INFO  [e.controller.debuglog.DebugLog] [ctrlDebugLog0] _sum[Ess SoC:0 %|L:0 W Grid L:0 W Production L:0 W Consumption L:0 W]`.
+
NOTE: It is once per second because you accepted the default value of "1000 ms" for "Cycle time" in the Scheduler configuration.

.. Configure the standard-load-profile datasource: "Simulator DataSource: Standard Load Profile". The default values can be accepted without changes.
+
.Configuration of Simulator DataSource: Standard Load Profile
image::config-simulator-datasource-standard-load-profile.png[Configuration of Simulator DataSource: Standard Load Profile]
+
The log shows:
+
`INFO  [onent.AbstractOpenemsComponent] [datasource0] Activate StandardLoadProfileDatasource [edge.simulator.datasource.standardloadprofile]`,
+
NOTE: The data source was configured with the OpenEMS Component ID "datasource0" which will be used in the next step as reference.

.. Configure a simulated grid meter: "Simulator GridMeter Acting". Configure the Datasource-ID "datasource0" to refer to the data source configured above.
+
.Configuration of Simulator GridMeter Acting
image::config-simulator-grid-meter-acting.png[Configuration of Simulator GridMeter Acting]
+
This time some more logs will show up. Most importantly they show, that the Grid meter now shows a power value.
+
----
INFO  [onent.AbstractOpenemsComponent] [meter0] Activate GridMeter [edge.simulator.meter.grid.acting]
[onent.AbstractOpenemsComponent] [meter0] Deactivate GridMeter [edge.simulator.meter.grid.acting]
[onent.AbstractOpenemsComponent] [meter0] Activate GridMeter [edge.simulator.meter.grid.acting]
[e.controller.debuglog.DebugLog] [ctrlDebugLog0] _sum[Ess SoC:0 %|L:0 W Grid L:1423 W Production L:0 W Consumption L:1423 W] meter0[1423 W] 
----
+
NOTE: This setup causes the simulated grid-meter to take the standardized load-profiles data as input parameter.
+
NOTE: 'Acting' referrs to the fact, that this meter actively provides data - in opposite to a 'Reacting' device that is reacting on other components: for example the 'Simulator.EssSymmetric.Reacting' configured below.

.. Configure a simulated reacting energy storage system: "Simulator EssSymmetric Reacting". The default values can be accepted without changes.
+
.Configuration of Simulator EssSymmetric Reacting
image::config-simulator-esssymmetric-reacting.png[Configuration of Simulator EssSymmetric Reacting]
+
The log shows:
+
`INFO  [e.controller.debuglog.DebugLog] [ctrlDebugLog0] _sum[Ess SoC:50 %|L:0 W Grid L:864 W Production L:0 W Consumption L:864 W] ess0[SoC:50 %|L:0 W|OnGrid] meter0[864 W]`
+
Note, that the DebugLog now shows data for the battery, but the charge/discharge power stays at "0 W" and the state of charge stays at "50 %" as configured. Next step is to configure a control algorithm that tells the battery to charge or discharge.

.. Configure the self-consumption optimization algorithm: "Controller Balancing Symmetric". Configure the Ess-ID "ess0" and Grid-Meter-ID "meter0" to refer to the components configured above.
+
.Configuration of Symmetric Balancing Controller
image::config-controller-balancing-symmetric.png[Configuration of Symmetric Balancing Controller]
+
The log shows:
+
`INFO  [e.controller.debuglog.DebugLog] [ctrlDebugLog0] _sum[Ess SoC:49 %|L:1167 W Grid L:-39 W Production L:0 W Consumption L:1128 W] ess0[SoC:49 %|L:1167 W|OnGrid] meter0[-39 W]`
+
NOTE: Note, how the Controller now tells the battery to discharge (`Ess SoC:49 %|L:1167 W`), trying to balance the Grid power to "0 W" (`Grid L:-39 W`):

.. Configure the websocket Api Controller: "Controller Api Websocket". The default values can be accepted without changes.
+
.Configuration of Controller Api Websocket
image::config-controller-api-websocket.png[Configuration of Controller Api Websocket]
+
The log shows:
+
----
INFO  [onent.AbstractOpenemsComponent] [ctrlApiWebsocket0] Activate WebsocketApi [edge.controller.api.websocket]
INFO  [ler.api.websocket.WebsocketApi] [ctrlApiWebsocket0] Websocket-Api started on port [8085].
----
+
NOTE: The Controller Api Websocket is required to enable access to OpenEMS Edge by a local OpenEMS UI.
